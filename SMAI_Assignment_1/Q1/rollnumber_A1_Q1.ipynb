    "### Instructions:\n",
    "1.   Assignment must be implemented using python notebook only (Colab , VsCode , Jupyter etc.)\n",
    "2.   You are allowed to use libraries for data preprocessing (numpy, pandas, nltk etc) and for algorithms as well (sklearn etc). You are not however allowed to directly use classifier models.\n",
    "3.   The performance of the model will hold weightage but you will also be graded largely for data preprocessing steps , explanations , feature selection for vectors etc.\n",
    "4.   Strict plagiarism checking will be done. An F will be awarded for plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "The dataset is avaible in the zip file which is a collection of *11099 tweets*. The data will be in the form of a csv file. The ground truth is also given in the zip file which corresponds to whether a tweet was popular or not. Since the task involves selecting features yourself to vectorize a tweet , we suggest some data analysis of the columns you consider important.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Task\n",
    "You have to build a classifier which can predict the popularity of the tweet, i.e , if the tweet was popular or not. You are required to use **KNN** algorithm to build the classifier and cannot use any inbuilt classifier. All columns are supposed to be analyzed , filtered and preprocessed to determine its importance as a feature in the vector for every tweet (Not every column will be useful).<br>\n",
    "The Data contains the **raw text of the tweet**(in the text column) as well as other **meta data** like likes count , user followers count. Note that it might be useful to **create new columns** with useful information. For example, *number of hashtags* might be useful but is not directly present as a column.<br>\n",
    "There are 3 main sub parts:\n",
    "1. *Vectorize tweets using only meta data* - likes , user followers count , and other created data\n",
    "2. *Vectorize tweets using only it's text*. This segment will require NLP techniques to clean the text and extract a vector using a BoW model. Here is a useful link for the same - [Tf-Idf](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-vectorization-term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency-tfidf-5a3f9604da6d). Since these vectors will be very large , we recommend reducing their dimensinality (~10 - 25). Hint: [Dimentionality Reduction](https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/machine-learning-singular-value-decomposition-svd-principal-component-analysis-pca-1d45e885e491). Please note that for this also you are allowed to use libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Combining the vectors from above two techinques to create one bigger vector*\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using KNN on these vectors build a classifier to predict the popularity of the tweet and report accuracies on each of the three methods as well as analysis. You can use sklearn's Nearest Neighbors and need not write KNN from scratch. (However you cannot use the classifier directly). You are expected to try the classifier for different number of neighbors and identify the optimal K value."
